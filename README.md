# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains C implementations of three CPU Scheduling algorithms: **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**, **Shortest Job First (SJF)**, and **Round Robin (RR)**.

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithms Explained

### 1. First Come First Serve (FCFS) 
- Processes are executed in the order they arrive (arrival time).  
- The first process that comes in is the first to execute.  
- **Scheduling Criteria:** Arrival Time  

---

### 2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
- The process with the **shortest burst time** is executed first.  
- Minimizes average waiting time but requires knowledge of burst times.  
- **Scheduling Criteria:** Burst Time  

---

### 3. Round Robin (RR) 
- Each process is given a fixed **time quantum**.  
- Processes are executed in a cyclic order until all finish.  
- Good for **time-sharing systems**.  
- **Scheduling Criteria:** Time Quantum
